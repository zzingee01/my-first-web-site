            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup 
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
            It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
            It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading 
            Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and 
            render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of 
            a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
